# Indoor-Localization-System

The goal of this project is to locate a receiver in a space with three access points, or WiFi routers, acting as transmitters. There are three steps to this:
First: obtaining the received signal strength in dbm from each of the three transmitters.
Second: determining the distance between the three access points using the received signal strength from the access points.
Third: determining the coordinates of the receiver if the transmitter's coordinates and its distance from it are known.

The project is written in Python,So prior understanding of the language is required. 
The additional libraries used are as follows: 
>> math 
>> subprocess  
>> numpy 
>> time 
>> openpyxl
